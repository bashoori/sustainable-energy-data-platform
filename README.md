# Sustainable Energy Data Ingestion & Analytics Platform

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a cloud-based data ingestion and analytics platform focused on energy sustainability and the Green Economy. The system ingests data from diverse sources including government open data portals, third-party APIs, CSV database exports, and PDF-based public reports.

The platform is designed to support reliable analytics, database-driven product features, and data quality validation using AWS, SQL, and Python.

## Key Objectives
- Lead acquisition, ingestion, and transformation of strategic energy data sources
- Design SQL-centric database schemas for analytics and reporting
- Implement scalable and maintainable data pipelines
- Enforce automated data quality validation
- Support evolving product requirements with flexible data models

## Data Sources
- Government open data APIs (energy production, emissions)
- Periodic CSV exports from external databases
- Public sustainability reports in PDF format

## Architecture
- Raw data ingestion into AWS S3
- SQL-based transformation and modeling
- Analytical queries for sustainability metrics
- Automated data quality checks integrated into pipelines

## Tech Stack
- AWS: S3, Redshift (logical), Lambda (conceptual)
- Languages: Python, SQL
- Analytics: Pandas, NumPy
- Testing: Python unit tests for data quality
- Version Control: Git

## Project Structure
See repository folders for ingestion, transformation, analytics, and testing layers.

## Why This Project Matters
This project reflects real-world database engineering challenges: messy data, evolving requirements, and the need for trustworthy analytics. It aligns with sustainability-focused products and demonstrates independent ownership of data pipelines end to end.
